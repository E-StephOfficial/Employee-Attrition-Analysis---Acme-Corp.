# Employee-Attrition-Analysis---Acme-Corp.

# Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my **Level 2 Codveda Internship in SQL for Business Analytics**. The focus was on analyzing employee attrition using IBM HR Analytics dataset and uncovering key drivers of employee turnover.

Since no project brief was provided, I created one from scratch â€” defining the business scenario, objectives, and deliverables â€” just like a consultant would.

# Business Scenario
Company: Acme Corp (fictional company for this analysis)
Attrition (employee turnover) is a critical HR challenge because it leads to recruitment costs, training expenses, and loss of productivity.
The objective of this project was to identify why employees are leaving and suggest actionable solutions to improve retention.

# Dataset
- Name: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
- Rows: 1,470 employees
- Source: Public dataset (included in this repository for reference)

# Tools & Skills
- SQL (SSMS â€“ SQL Server Management Studio)
- Querying, joins, grouping, filtering
- Business problem framing
- Data storytelling with slides (infographics)

# Key Insights
- Overall attrition was 16%.
- Sales Representatives had the highest attrition (~40%).
- Younger employees (less than age 30) had higher attrition (~28%).
- Low-income staff and those working overtime were at higher risk of leaving.
- Long commutes (>20 km) also contributed to turnover.

# Recommendations
1. Review compensation for lower income bands.
2. Limit overtime to balance workloads.
3. Implement retention programs for Sales staff and younger employees.
4. Offer flexible work or relocation support for employees with long commutes.

# Project presentation
I also created an infographic slide deck instead of just showing SQL scripts, to make the insights more engaging for stakeholders.

# Key Takeaway
Attrition isnâ€™t random â€” itâ€™s concentrated in specific groups. With only SQL, I was able to uncover actionable business insights without relying on BI dashboards.
